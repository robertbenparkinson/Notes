# My Code Notes

A few years ago I realized that I was not as smart as I thought that I was and I was not able to keep everything in my head.Luckily people much smarter than me invented paper and pencils then some time after that other people invented computers and the internet, so here we are.

This Git repo are my notes from a bunch of different coding projects over the last several years. I am in the process of migrating them over from other sources, including a suspiciously number of notepad txt files. Please feel free to take a look. If any of it helps you out, great. Let me know.
